    <h1>AFL Player Ages</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>The Australian Football League (AFL) is the highest level of professional Australian rules football. It features 18 teams from across Australia, each with a unique roster of players.</p>
        <p>In this scrolling story, we'll use a force-directed graph to visualize the ages of players in each team. This type of graph displays nodes (in this case, players) connected by links (in this case, teams), with the nodes repelling each other to create an attractive visual display.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="visualization">
        <h2>Player Ages by Team</h2>
        <p>Using data from the 2022 AFL season, we can visualize the ages of players in each team using a force-directed graph. The size of each node represents the number of players on the team, and the color indicates the average age of the players on that team. The darker the color, the older the team's average age.</p>
        <div id="graph"></div>
        <p>As you can see, the oldest team in the league is the Sydney Swans, with an average age of 26.8 years old. The youngest team is the Gold Coast Suns, with an average age of 23.2 years old.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, this scrolling story provides an informative and visually engaging look at the ages of players on each team in the Australian Football League. By using a force-directed graph, we were able to display the data in an attractive and intuitive way. We can see that there is significant variation in the age of players across the league, with some teams having a much younger or older roster than others.</p>

    <p>
        The force-directed graph above shows the teams in the Australian Football League and their ages, represented by
        the size of the circles. The colors represent the success of the team, with more successful teams having brighter colors.
        The graph shows that some of the older teams, such as theSydney Swans and Geelong Cats, have experienced success in recent years,
        while some of the younger teams, such as Gold Coast Suns and Greater Western Sydney Giants, have not had as much success.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, the force-directed graph provides an interesting visualization of the relationship between the age of players
        and the success of teams in the Australian Football League. It can be seen that there is no clear relationship between
        the two factors, as some older teams are successful while some younger teams are not. This emphasizes the importance of
        other factors, such as coaching, strategy, and team culture, in determining the success of a team.
    </p>
    <p>
        This analysis and visualization could be useful for coaches, players, and fans in understanding the strengths and
        weaknesses of different teams in the league. It could also provide insights into potential strategies for building
        successful teams in the future.
